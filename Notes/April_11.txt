Project Architecture:

    Parameters:
        robot_count
        robot_names
        anchor_robot_name
        combined_flag
        robot_description

    Packages:
        rsp_bringup
            Description: Launches gazebo / Rviz / tele-operation(from keyboard) from user (Joystick), stores all the urdf and robot_description, robot state publisher
            Launch files:
                rsp_turtlebot3_bringup.launch 
        rsp_navigation (Not implemented yet)
            Nodes:
                recofiguration_node
                    service argument: “robot_name_1 robot_name_2 combine/split”
                    Valid actions include: split / join / space (move with certain spacing) 
                    Call navigation_node 
                    Sets rosparam flag
                    Create static tf between two robots to form/break up links (then we won’t use rsp_pathplanning if this is working)
                multirobot_control_node: (Not implemented yet)
                    input
                    service msgs input: “robot_name configuration_ID posx posy rotz” 
                    output: service
                    Moves multiple robots.
                navigation_node: (Not implemented yet)
                    input topics: nothing!
                    service msgs input: “robot_name posx posy rotz” 
                    uses: turtlebot_3 move_base, need to change so that it matches the argument we use.
                    output topics: nothing!
                    Moves 1 robot.
            Launch files:

        rsp_pathplanning (Not implemented yet)
            Nodes: 
                rsp_pathplanning  
                    Description: Publishes to the navigation_node and multirobot_control_node in rsp_navigation package, receiving inputs from rsp_user_control (if robot is voltron’d)
                    How to optimize the path: ie. reconfiguring robots, going around obstacles. 
                rsp_user_control  
                    Nodes:
                        rsp_teleop_key:
                        rsp_teleop_joy: (Not implemented yet)
                        gui_control_node (Not implemented yet)
                            rviz plugin??
                        control_node
                            Gets user input and executes various functionality. Expect command line style functionality (user publish to topic?) 
                                “move x y”
                                “combine robot1 robot2”
                                “move robot1 ”
                                “Move robot_group x y theta” (access rsp_planning)                  
                    Launch files:
                        rsp_turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch
